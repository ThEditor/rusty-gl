# rusty-gl

A safe wrapper for OpenGL functions in rust.

This library sits in-between your application and OpenGL. It attempts to provide a better way of accessing OpenGL functions safely and elegantly.

NOTE: For now, this is mainly being developed for [rpong](https://github.com/ThEditor/rpong) but contributions are welcome.
